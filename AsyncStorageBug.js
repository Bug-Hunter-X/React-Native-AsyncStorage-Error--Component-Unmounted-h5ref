In React Native, an uncommon error arises when using AsyncStorage within a component that unmounts prematurely.  If you try to access AsyncStorage after the component has unmounted, you'll get an error because the component's internal state and methods are no longer accessible. This usually manifests as a warning or an error related to accessing a component that is not mounted or accessing a null reference. This happens because AsyncStorage's asynchronous nature means that the response may not return until *after* the component has been unmounted.
